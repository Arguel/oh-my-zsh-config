Oh My ZSH! config

The Oh My ZSH installation guide is on their [github repository](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

I personally use the powerlevel10k theme, this configuration is under the name ".p10k.zsh", it is important to mention that you have to install it first, in its [original repository](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) instructions are found

And then the main Oh My ZSH configuration is in the ".zshrc" file which is based to use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with some improvements

To use the files from this repository you only need to place them in your user's directory, in the case of ubuntu it would be <code>/home/.p10k.zsh</code>
